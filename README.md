# Binary Search Tree
## Description
This project was done to learn about the binary search tree data structure as part
of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/binary-search-trees).

This project takes an array and converts it to a binary search tree. There are
methods for level order, preorder, inorder, and postorder traversal. Each of
the traversal methods produces an array. There are also methods for inserting
and deleting elements from the tree. Finally, there is a method to check if
the tree is balanced, and to rebalance it if it is unbalanced.

## Reflection
Some of the recursive methods used with binary search trees were difficult to
wrap my head around.
